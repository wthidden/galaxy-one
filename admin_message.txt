**StarWeb v2.0 - December 2024 Update** 🚀

**Major Changes:**

• **Turn Timer System** - Set your preferred turn time when joining: `JOIN YourName 60 EmpireBuilder` (5-1440 minutes)
• **Immediate World Capture** - Capture worlds the same turn you arrive (no more waiting!)
• **Character-Specific Scoring** - All 6 character types now have proper scoring per official rules
• **Defense Display** - Now shows I#/P# format (e.g., "I5/P3") for clarity
• **Homeworld Improvements** - Starting worlds are 1+ hops apart, no artifacts on homeworlds

**Important Rules:**
- Defensive ships (iships/pships) guarantee world ownership even without fleets
- Building defenses on neutral world claims it immediately
- Turn timer is the average of all players' preferences
